        <h2>Neon Runner</h2>
        <p>A fast-paced cyberpunk arcade game. Dodge obstacles, collect power-ups, and chase high scores in a neon-lit world. Built with tight controls and a focus on "one more run" gameplay.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>DreamMaze</h2>
        <p>A puzzle adventure through surreal, dreamlike worlds. Solve environmental puzzles, uncover a subtle narrative, and explore spaces that shift between logic and imagination.</p>

    <h2>Why we make games</h2>
    <p>Games are where we combine code, art, and interaction into a single experience. We're drawn to small-scale projects that we can polish to a high level — prototypes that feel complete, and ideas that leave a lasting impression. We use engines like Unity and Godot, and we're not afraid to try custom tools when the project calls for it. Expect more titles and experiments as we grow.</p>
